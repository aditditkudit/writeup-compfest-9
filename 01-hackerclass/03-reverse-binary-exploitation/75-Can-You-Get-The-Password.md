## Write Up
- The correct flag is 33 characters and after some operation must be equal to r array.
- If we observe the fungsi1(), the output is equal to second parameter.
- If we observe the fungsi2(), the output is equal to (first parameter) * (second parameter).
- We just need to reverse the operation.
- We can use this script to get that flag:

```python
r = [-67,0,77,160,210,284,419,504,415,1000,493,510,1207,1344,1412,726,1457,1824,871,2124,969,2280,1145,1134,2233,2480,1232,2996,2621,3396,1424,3530,3939]
s = ""

for i in range(33):
    if (i - 1 == 0):
        s = s + chr((r[i] ^ i) - i)
    else:
        s = s + chr(((r[i] ^ i) - i) / (i - 1))

print(s)
```

- We will get `C MPFEST9{51mpl3_r3v3r53_f0r_y0u}`. And we know the second character is O.
- So the flag: `COMPFEST9{51mpl3_r3v3r53_f0r_y0u}`.
